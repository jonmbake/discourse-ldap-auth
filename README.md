# discourse-ldap-auth

A [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) plugin to enable LDAP/ActiveDirectory authentication.

## Setup

Checkout: [Installing a Plugin](https://meta.discourse.org/t/install-a-plugin/19157).

## Configuration

After the plugin is installed, logging in as an Admin and navigating to `admin/site_settings/category/plugins` will enable you to specify your LDAP settings.  Most of the configuration options are documented in [omniauth-ldap](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth-ldap).

## A Note on User Account Creation

By default, user accounts are automatically created (if they don't already exist) after authentication using *name*, *nickname* and *email* attributes of the LDAP entry.  If you do not want this behavior, you can change the *ldap_user_create_mode* configuration value to one of the following:

  Name | Description
-------| --------------
auto   | Automatically create a Discourse Account after authenticating through LDAP if account does not exist (default).
list   | Provide a list of users in *ldap_users.yml*.  Will only create an account and pass authentication if user with email is in list. See example [ldap_user.yml](ldap_users.yml).
none   | Fail auth if the user account does not already exist.  This is a good option for an Admin that creates accounts ahead of time.

*list* also allows the specifying of *User Groups*, which will be automatically assigned to the user on creation.  It also allows specifying a different *username* (for local account) and *name* for the Discourse User Account than what is returned in the LDAP entry.

## Yet Another Note on the _Attribute to lookup users by_ Setting

The _Lookup Users By Attribute_ setting specifies how to to link the LDAP response entry to a user within _Discourse_. By
default, it uses the _email_ attribute in the LDAP entry to try and find an existing Discourse user. If email address is
unlikely to change for a given user, it is a good idea to keep this default setting.

If, on the other hand, LDAP email address has the possibility of changing, setting _Attribute to lookup users by_ to _username_ is the way to go to avoid "de-linking"
the Discourse User from its corresponding LDAP entry.

The only possible values are _email_ or _username_.

## Other Tips

When disabling Local Login and other authentication services, clicking the `Login` or `Sign Up` button will directly bring up the LDAP Login popup.
